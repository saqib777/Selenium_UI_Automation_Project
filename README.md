# Selenium UI Automation Project

This repository documents my hands-on journey into UI automation using Selenium.  
It is not just a collection of scripts, but a learning-driven project where I explored automation design, debugging strategies, and real-world testing challenges step by step.

The goal of this project is to understand **how UI automation actually works in practice** — beyond writing scripts — including failures, fixes, and improvements.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on automating web UI flows using Selenium, while documenting:

- How test cases are designed
- How locators are chosen and optimized
- How failures are debugged
- How automation evolves with better structure and understanding

Instead of rushing to build a “perfect framework,” I intentionally focused on **learning the fundamentals deeply** and recording what worked, what failed, and why.

## What I Worked On

### UI Automation
- Automated common user flows such as navigation, form interactions, and validations
- Used Selenium to simulate real user behavior
- Focused on stability rather than speed

### Locator Strategy
- Experimented with different locator types:
  - ID
  - Name
  - XPath
  - CSS Selectors
- Learned why some locators fail over time and how to make them more reliable

### Debugging Automation Failures
- Handled common Selenium issues such as:
  - Element not found
  - Timing issues
  - Stale element references
- Learned to debug failures by analyzing logs instead of guessing

### Documentation-First Approach
- Maintained a written record of:
  - Automation decisions
  - Mistakes and corrections
  - Debugging thought process

This helped me understand automation as a **process**, not just code execution.
